We'll build and iterate over a simple API, exploring concepts that give your API a solid foundation: authentication, REST based design and workflows, practical hypermedia, versioning, API request\/response formats. Because your API may start out serving the needs of internal mobile clients, or single page web apps, but one day (sooner than you think) you'll be turning it into a public API.",

A single security vulnerability in a widespread open-source PHP application can be used to compromise thousands of server installations. But how bad is the security state of open-source applications and plugins today? This talk covers common and quirky security issues and mistakes detected lately. We introduce static analysis techniques for the automated detection of these complex issues and a summary of the most prevalent risks and pitfalls that should be avoided in your application.",

            "description": "Minority Report was a 2002 American science fiction film based in 2054 where police officers apprehended criminals based on predictions and foreknowledge. We are not in 2054 but fast-forward to 2017; we are now closer than ever before to the world imagined in Minority Report because of Machine Learning (ML). ML is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. During this talk, the secrets behind ML are uncovered, and attendees walk away with the knowledge to incorporate ML into their own applications.",

We\u2019ll talk about how to incorporate modern PHP coding practices to replace code and retiring the older code in pieces. We\u2019ll review examples and code from a project where we bootstrapped a legacy application that needed a lot of work. We\u2019ll talk about strategies to leave the existing code in place until the new code is ready to replace it in whole or in pieces.",
